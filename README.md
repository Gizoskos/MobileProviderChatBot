# Mobile Provider Chatbot

This project is a **chat-based assistant system** for a mobile provider billing platform. Users can interact with the chatbot to query their monthly bill, request detailed billing information, or make partial/full payments. The system integrates Firebase Firestore, a Spring Boot backend, and Together.ai for natural language understanding.

## System Design

### Architecture Overview

```plaintext
[User Interface - React + Firebase Firestore]
                 |
          [API Gateway - Node.js]
        â†™                   â†˜
[Spring Boot REST API]    [Together.ai for NLP]

React Frontend: Collects user input and pushes messages to Firebase Firestore.

API Gateway: Acts as a proxy, handles JWT login, forwards requests to Spring API.

Agent Service: Listens to Firestore changes, detects intent using Together.ai, and interacts with Spring API.

Spring Boot Backend: Handles business logic for billing, payments, and data persistence.
```
## Assumptions
```plaintext
User IDs are predefined and mapped to billing records in the Spring Boot backend.

Message structure in Firestore follows:
{
  "text": "what is my bill",
  "sender": "user",
  "userId": "123",
  "createdAt": timestamp,
  "handled": false
}
Together.ai is used with a system prompt to parse structured JSON from free-form user text.

Frontend expects bot responses to be stored in the same Firestore collection with sender: "bot"
```

## Challenges Encountered
```plaintext
Firestore Watch Failure in Deployments:

Render environment limits streaming connections.

Replaced real-time onSnapshot with polling via setInterval.

Firebase Admin SDK Authentication Errors:

Misconfigured or improperly encoded private key caused "invalid credential" errors.

Solution: Converted JSON key to a single-line string and used JSON.parse(process.env.FIREBASE_CREDENTIAL).

Together.ai Rate Limits:

Project exceeded QPS/TPS during rapid development.

Added try/catch with informative fallbacks.

JWT Login Loop in Gateway:

Infinite forwarding due to misrouting /api/v1/auth to itself.

Handled LOGIN_ENDPOINT explicitly and skipped proxying that path.
